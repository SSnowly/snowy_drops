## My customdrop model is different then configured?
This is because we changed the dropmodel convar so that we can correctly remove the model spawned by ox_inventory, if you are using this resource please always set [dropmodel](https://overextended.dev/ox_inventory/Functions/Server#customdrop) to `prop_paper_bag_small`.
